1. Write a program to accept a number from the user and count the number of digits in the number.

	Expected output:
	
	Enter any number:
	14567
	The number of digits in the entered number is 5

2.  Write a program to accept a number from the user and find the sum of digits in the entered number.
	Expected output:
	
	Enter any number:
	14567
	The sum of digits of the entered number is 22

3.  Write a program to accept a number from the user and find the reverse of the entered number.

	Expected output:
	
	Enter any number:
	45646
	Reverse of the entered number is 64654

4.   Write a program to accept a number from the user and determine whether it is an Armstrong number or not.
	(Example: 153 is an Armstrong number 1^3 + 5 ^3 +3 ^3 =153)

5.   Write a program to accept a number from the user and calculate the sum of digits of the number; repeat the operation till the sum gets to be a single digit number.

	Expected output:
	
	Enter any number:
	9981
	Single digit sum is: 9
	(Hint: 9+9+8+1 = 27; 2+7 = 9)

6.   Write a program to accept a number from the user and count the number of prime digits.

	Expected output:
	
	Enter any number:
	97512
	Number of prime digits in the entered number is 3

7.   Write a program to accept a number and find the factorial of the number (using while loop).

8.   Write a program to accept a four digit number from the user and display its denomination.

	Example: 5698
	Output: 5*1000 =5000
	6*100 =600
	9*10 =90
	8*1 =8

9.   Write a program to accept a five digit number from the user, increment each digit by one and display the number (digit 9 gets incremented to 0).

	Example:
	Input: 14385
	Output: 25496
	
10.   Write a program to accept 2 numbers “m” and “n” from the user and determine m^n (without using predefined functions).
