
Fundamentals of Programming using "for":

1. Write a program to accept a number from the user and print its multiplication table (upto “times 10”).
2. Write a program to accept a number and find the factorial of the number.
3. Write a program to accept a number, calculate the sum of all even numbers from 0 till the given number; similarly repeat the same for the odd numbers; then display these two sums. (Example: input number 6; sum of even numbers = 0+2+4+6 =12, sum of odd numbers = 1+3+5 = 9)
4. Write a program to accept a number from the user; display the natural number series for the entered number (1,2,3,4,…,N) and calculate the sum of this series.
5. Write a program to accept a number and determine whether it is a prime number or not.
6. Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to the number 34. (Example: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,…Series starts with 0 and 1, the succeeding numbers of the series are arrived by adding the previous 2 numbers.)
7. Write a program to accept a number “n” from the user; then display the sum of the series 1+1/2+1/3+……….+1/n.
8. Write a program to accept a number “n” from the user; then display the series 1,3,5,7,9,…,n and find the sum of the numbers in this series.
9. Write a program to accept 2 different numbers from the user and print the prime numbers between these 2 numbers.
